            <p>Mitch Taylor is one of the youngest students ever accepted to a university known for its programs for geniuses. He partners up with his roommate, science club legend Chris Knight, on a project to develop a high-powered laser. Together with their hyperkinetic friends, they employ their intellects in the pursuit of bigger blasts, practical jokes, and a deeper understanding of what real genius means. When they find out that their professor intends to turn their work over to the military for use as a weapon, they decide to get even.</p>

 			      <p>As the smartest guy in the school, Chris Knight is the head of the laser project that Professor Hathaway has secretly promised to the military. Though his goofing off and lack of presence in the lab drives Hathaway to the point of Hari-kiri.</p>

                  <p>Laslo Hollyfeld was smart guy on campus before Chris and Mitch. He couldn't take the pressure and cracked up. He now lives in a series of tunnel that he enters through Chris and Mitch's closet. He is seen here with his entries into the Frito Lay sweepstakes.</p>

                  <p>Kent is a suck up to Professor Hathaway. He's quick to tell on his fellow classmates Chris Knight and Mitch Taylor. For a smart guy, he's not the brightest bulb.</p>
